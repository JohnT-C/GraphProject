# GraphProjec
This project is an implementation of a graph data structure
It has the following functions:
  Graph.add() which takes in data and a list of connections and establishes it as a node
  Graph.draw() this function simply renders the graph using turtle
  Graph.search() which returns the connections of the searched for node
  textenter and read_enter are both functions that create graphs from different inputs
